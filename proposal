Team <Undecided>
Members: Conan Wong, Anthony Chen & Sebastian Dittgen

Idea: A recreation of Conan and Suwamik's favorite pastime, Choprock. It
will allow two people on the same network to play a game in real time.
The game consists of two players playing rock, paper, scissors repeatedly to
determine who gets to make the move in chopsticks. The player who wins in
the chopsticks portion of the game wins.

Interface: A user enters their name and waits for a match with another user.
During the match, the users pick either rock, paper, or scissors and the winner
of rock,paper,scissors is allowed to make a move (strike, transfer fingers, etc.)
and the loser is required to wait until the winner chooses a move. Repeat until
a winner is found in the chopsticks portion.

Design: It will utilize a handshake system similar to the one we had to do for
homework, as well as a backend that recieves the input and sends out the
necessary information to each client. When we learn how to establish the
connection through the network, that will also be used. There will be heavy
stress on processes, memory allocation, and networking.

Work breakdown:
Anthony - Client
Sebastian - Server
Conan - Backend
[Everyone will work on each part, but predominantly the one listed]

Data structures used: Some experimentation with arrays to be able to host
and mix-match users for matches. Storing data efficiently will be one of our
priorities, so there's an indecision on which structure is the best currently.

Completion date of parts:
Client -> 3rd day into work
Server -> 4th day into work
Backend -> 5th day into work
==Support for multiple users: 6-7th day into work
